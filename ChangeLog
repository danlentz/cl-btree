	  test/unit/b-tree-test.lisp,
	  test/unit/backtracking-list-iterator.lisp, vendor,
	  vendor/lisp-unit.lisp, vendor/mock.lisp: Refactored cl-btree to
	  use lisp-unit by Christopher K. Riesbeck.
	  Note: vendor dir contains slightly modified lisp-unit (with
	  assert-typep).
	  Also, mock functions from cl-unit-test is used still.
	  Unit tests were refactored with following modifications:
	  - def-test (name) -> define-test name
	  - assert-typep obj type -> assert-typep type obj
	  - assert-condition error -> assert-error 'error
	  - unit tests are in their own package
	  - all symbols need to have package specification
